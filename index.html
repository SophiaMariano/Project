        <h1>Air Pollution: An Overview</h1>
        <p>Air is a really important part of our lives. We live because we breathe air. Therefore, it is important that the air we breathe is safe and clean. Our air quality is being threatened by air pollution. Air pollution is when pollutants are released into the air. These pollutants are chemical, physical, and biological agents that contaminate the air and reduce its quality. A reduction in air quality can cause adverse health effects such as respiratory problems. Every year, there are 7 million premature deaths caused by air pollution. This is a dire problem and it needs to be addressed.
