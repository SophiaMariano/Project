        <p>Here are some causes and effects of air pollution.</p>

          <h2>Causes of Air Pollution</h2>
          <h4>Greenhouse Gases</h4>
          <p>The burning of fossil fuels produces harmful greenhouse gasses that pollute the environment. Examples of these greenhouse gasses include carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide.</p>
          <h4>Vehicles</h4>
          <p>Vehicles also cause air pollution. They produce gasses which contribute to the production of greenhouse gasses. Hence, areas with more cars are more polluted and have low air quality.</p>
         <h4>Mismanagement of Waste</h4>
         <p>Mismanagement of waste can also cause air pollution. If not disposed properly, different types of waste can spread bacteria and bad odor. Additionally, plastics and other materials can produce harmful chemicals. This can cause air pollution. </p>

          <h2>Effects of Air Pollution</h2>
          <h4>Respiratory Problems and Other Diseases</h4>
          <p>Air pollution can cause respiratory diseases. This is because the quality of the air we breathe is reduced. Harmful chemicals and other pollutants that enter our lungs may cause respiratory diseases. 
</p>
          <h4>Global Warming</h4>
          <p>Air pollution involves the emission of greenhouse gasses. These greenhouse gasses go up into the atmosphere and trap heat from the sun. Hence, global warming happens. 
</p>
          <h4>Harmful Effects for Animals</h4>
          <p>Aside from humans, animals are also affected. They also need good air quality to survive. Thus, if air quality is reduced, their habitat may be ruined and they would be forced to migrate and find a new home.
