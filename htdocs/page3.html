        <div class="reasonscontainer">
          <div class="reasons">Air pollution has many health risks. The pollutants in the air can irritate our lungs and eyes. They may cause different types of respiratory diseases. The effects are even worse for people with asthma.</div>
          <div class="reasons">About 93 percent of children breathe polluted air. This is alarming because they are still developing. This may affect their development and cause chronic diseases later in life.</div>
